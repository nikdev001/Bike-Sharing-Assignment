# Bike-Sharing-Assignment

Upgrad Bike Sharing Linear Regression Assignment
Introduction
This notebook contains an assignment focused on building a linear regression model to predict bike-sharing demand. The dataset used in this assignment includes various features that influence bike rentals, such as weather conditions, time of year, and other relevant factors. The goal is to apply linear regression techniques to analyze and predict bike rental demand.

File Structure
Upgrad_Bike_Sharing_Linear_Regression_Assignment.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis, model building, and evaluation steps.
Contents
1. Import Libraries
The initial section where necessary Python libraries are imported.

2. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
This section involves loading the dataset, exploring its structure, handling missing values, and performing necessary preprocessing steps like encoding categorical variables and feature scaling.

3. Data Visualization
Here, various visualizations are created to understand the relationships between different features and the target variable (bike rentals).

4. Model Building
In this section, a linear regression model is built using the preprocessed data. The model's parameters are tuned, and it is trained on the dataset.

5. Model Evaluation
The performance of the linear regression model is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), etc. The results are analyzed to understand the model's effectiveness in predicting bike rentals.

6. Conclusion
A summary of findings, model performance, and potential areas for improvement are discussed.
